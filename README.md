# Environment-mapping

## Description

Our project is a Pygame application using OpenGL to demonstrate environment mapping with interactive object viewing and dynamic reflections. The scene features a reflective cube, sphere, and torus that mirror their surroundings defined by a cubemap. Users can switch between different cubemap sets to see how reflections change with the environment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy pygame PyOpenGL Pillow

## Installation and Usage

```bash
$ pip install pygame PyOpenGL Pillow numpy
$ git clone https://github.com/KamilCzajczyk/Environment-mapping
$ cd Environment-mapping/
```

```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

## Project structure

- `bridge/` , `bridge2/` , `yokohama2/` , `yokohama3/` folders with cubemap images
- `engine/` files needed to run the program
- `config.py` configuration file
- `main.py` main file to run
